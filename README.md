 ASF's Angular search web application

## Deployments

- **Devel:** https://search-dev.asf.alaska.edu/
- **Test:** https://search-test.asf.alaska.edu/
- **Prod:** https://search.asf.alaska.edu/


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Intialize after downloading
After you first download the repo, setup your instance by doing `npm install` from the project root directory. If you don't have npm installed go [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for installation instructions. 

## Development server

The app is run locally using the Angular CLI. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://angular.io/cli). After angular is installed, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You can optionally supply a port number, for example `ng serve --port 4444`
If you change your host file on your local machine then this command might be appropriate `ng serve --port 4444 --host local.asf.alaska.edu`.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Install NPM Packages
Run `npm install --save package_name` to install a package.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Installing pip and mkDocs

Install pip: 
`curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`

Then run the following command in the folder where you have downloaded get-pip.py:
`python get-pip.py`

You can upgrade pip at anytime, or make sure you are have the latest version
installed using the command: `pip install -U pip`

#### python 3 and pip on OS X
For Apple OS X systems, this is the recommended approach to installing python 3 and pip.
While OS X comes with a large number of Unix utilities, those familiar with Linux systems
will notice one key component missing: a package manager. Homebrew fills this void.

To install Homebrew, open Terminal or your favorite OS X terminal emulator and run

`$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

The script will explain what changes it will make and prompt you before the installation begins. Once youâ€™ve installed Homebrew, insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your ~/.profile file

`export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"`
