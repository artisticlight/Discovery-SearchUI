This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Intialize after downloading
After you first download the repo, setup your instance by doing `npm install` from the project root directory. If you don't have npm installed go [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for installation instructions. 

## Development server

The app is run locally using the Angular CLI. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://angular.io/cli). After angular is installed, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You can optionally supply a port number, for example `ng serve --port 4444`
If you change your host file on your local machine then this command might be appropriate `ng serve --port 4444 --host local.asf.alaska.edu`.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Install NPM Packages
Run `npm install --save package_name` to install a package.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
